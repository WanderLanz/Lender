   = help: consider adding the following bound: `'short: 'long`
   = note: requirement occurs because of a mutable reference to `[Cell<Option<&String>>]`
   = note: mutable references are invariant over their type parameter
   = help: see <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html> for more information about variance
   = note: this error originates in the macro `lender::covariance_check` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
