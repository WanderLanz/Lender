   | |______lifetime `'__long` defined here
   |        function was supposed to return data with lifetime `'__long` but it is returning data with lifetime `'__short`
   |
   = help: consider adding the following bound: `'__short: '__long`
   = note: requirement occurs because of the type `__CovarCheck<'_>`, which makes the generic argument `'_` invariant
   = note: the struct `__CovarCheck<'lend>` is invariant over the parameter `'lend`
   = help: see <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html> for more information about variance
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__covar__` which comes from the expansion of the macro `covar_mut` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
